## How do I approach designing software?
I typically approach designing software by looking at the requirements and then planning out the steps needed to complete the requirements.
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The work on this particular project has enabled me to learn skills with creating computer graphics in OpenGL as well as thinking through and understanding complex computer operations and rendering.
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
Similar to how I approach designing software, I looked at what the project required of me, and then set out to design my 3d scene as accurately and efficiently as I could while meeting the requirements of the project as they were written.
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I believe this would work very well for future work, as planning and designing around project requirements will ensure that expectations are met.
## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I didn't really utilize any new development strategies, but continuosly making small adjustments and testing small sections of code at time were very helpful as always.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was paramount to my development style, as continously making new, small additions or improvements to the code helps me to add new code to the existing code base in manageable increments. 
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The approach was mostly the same, utilizing the code base that we were initially given and making small adjustments and additions to it until it fit the requirements of the assignment.
## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Every new skill in my toolbox will enable me to branch out in new directions in order to learn more, as well as the experience from this class will help me understand other fields of development that I have not yet touched on. 
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
While I have no current plans of utilizing computer graphics on such a granular level in a future professional career, it is always helpful to learn how such programs function in case I ever need to create a graphic for say, data analytics from scratch.
